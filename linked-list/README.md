# Linked List Implementation 

[PR](https://github.com/401-Python/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/linked-list)  
[![Build Status]()

## Feature Tasks
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
* Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
* Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
* Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
* Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List.
* Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capturable errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.
Be sure to follow your language/frameworks standard naming conventions (e.g. C# uses PascalCasing for all method and class names).

## Implementation
 * Instantiate a Node class with a value and a next pointer
 * Instantiate a Linked List class with head and tail pointers

## methods

  * ```insert(val)``` takes in a value, and creates a new node with that val at the head of the list
  * ```includes(val)``` takes in a value and returns a boolean, true if val if present in the linked list
