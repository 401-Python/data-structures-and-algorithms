# Array Reverse
[PR]()  
[![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.com/alvian-401-advanced-javascript/data-structures-and-algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.com/alvian-401-advanced-javascript/data-structures-and-algorithms)

## Feature Tasks
* Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Implemntation
  I accomplished this using a single while loop to take a single item from the end of the
  input list, and appending it to a new list. During each iteration I decrement a counter which is equal to the length of the input list -1. When the counter reaches zero I print the new list.
